                            <p>The festival started in 1999, with 27 local talents performing to a small crowd of enthusiasts. It has since grown substantially, with the addition of many new stages and thousands of people turning up each year. ODYSSEY Music Festival is regarded by some as the primary influence in jump-starting the South African rock music movement in the late 90's. It attracts thousands of attendees annually.<br/><br/>
    The organizers have been through a lot to get this festival off the ground, including; "rolled bakkies, burnt tents, driven over knees, slept in jails, slept outside jails and turned over several stones to make gigs and festivals work."<br/><br/>
    In 2008, the Daily Mirror ranked ODYSSEY as the 4th best music festival in the world.<br/><br/>
    The festival has grown yearly, with 16 000 attendees and around 100 acts for both 2010 and 2011 and an estimated 20 000 attendees and 130 acts for 2015.<br/><br/>
    So for all the fans and members of the extended ODYSSEY family a massive thank you for shaping this monster with us. Also have a look and please submit some of your photos and memories in celebration of this annual South African tune migration to info@odyssey.co.za.</p>
